Splice gives AI coding agents a browser they can understand, audit, and recover inside. It does not stop at screenshots, raw DOM, or accessibility snapshots. Splice diagnoses browser state, compiles intent into verified actions, redacts hostile page content, and records the evidence agents need to keep moving safely.

## Why Splice

Modern web agents fail in boring, expensive ways: stale refs, hidden modals, disabled buttons, route transitions, validation traps, login expiry, CAPTCHAs, and silent clicks that did nothing. Most browser tools expose more page data. Splice exposes browser understanding.

Splice is built for coding agents that need to inspect, operate, debug, and improve real web applications through the Model Context Protocol.

| Agent problem | Splice answer |
| --- | --- |
| "Why did that click fail?" | Agent State Forensics classifies obstruction, validation, auth, loading, CAPTCHA, network, or missing-target states. |
| "Which element should I use?" | Verified Intent Actions rank candidates, produce preconditions, postconditions, risk, alternatives, and optional execution. |
| "Did the action actually work?" | Post-action verification checks page change, diagnosis state, text evidence, and domain constraints. |
| "Can the page inject instructions?" | Prompt-injection scanning redacts hostile text before it reaches the agent. |
| "Can a site leak secrets?" | Egress firewall blocks outbound secret patterns in non-GET requests. |
| "What happened during the run?" | Command Center renders timeline, forensics, verified plans, branches, audits, and telemetry. |

---

## Flagship Features

### Agent State Forensics

Splice can diagnose the current browser state before an agent wastes another step.

```json
{
  "state": "ui_obstruction",
  "confidence": 0.89,
  "summary": "The agent is likely blocked by a visible overlay, modal, or pointer obstruction.",
  "evidence": [
    "Visible dialog or overlay may be intercepting actions: \"Subscribe to continue\".",
    "Current agent goal: submit checkout form"
  ],
  "recommendedNextAction": {
    "tool": "compile_verified_action",
    "target": "close/dismiss control",
    "reason": "Dismiss the obstruction before continuing the workflow."
  }
}
```

Use the MCP tool:

```json
{
  "name": "diagnose_agent_state",
  "arguments": {
    "goal": "submit checkout form",
    "lastActions": ["filled email", "clicked continue"]
  }
}
```

### Verified Intent Actions

Splice compiles natural-language intent into a browser action plan with evidence.

```json
{
  "intent": "click the pricing link",
  "confidence": 0.91,
  "risk": "low",
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "click",
      "target": "a-12",
      "why": "Best semantic and visual match: \"Pricing\" scored 34."
    }
  ],
  "preconditions": [
    "Target a-12 is visible.",
    "Target a-12 is enabled.",
    "Target a-12 is not visually obstructed at its center point."
  ],
  "postconditions": [
    "URL, title, focused element, or visible page text should change in a way consistent with the intent."
  ]
}
```

Use the MCP tool:

```json
{
  "name": "compile_verified_action",
  "arguments": {
    "intent": "click the pricing link",
    "execute": true,
    "constraints": {
      "noNavigationOutsideDomain": true,
      "avoidDestructiveActions": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Semantic Extraction

Splice generates AI-optimized semantic trees with lenses for UX, security, performance, network, behavior, and vision workflows. Intent pruning and token budgets keep page observations compact without losing actionable controls.

### Agentic Security Firewall

- Prompt-injection redaction for hidden or visible hostile instructions
- Secret egress blocking for common API key, JWT, Stripe, and AWS patterns
- Local secret scanning before publication
- Encrypted session snapshots with AES-256-GCM
- Extended security audit: scans for unsecured OpenClaw ports, DOM-level WebSocket script injections, and unverified high-privilege workspace skills

### Command Center

The local dashboard turns a browser run into an inspectable operations console:

- Causal timeline of browser actions
- State forensics and verified action plans
- Active branches and speculative execution state
- Security audit findings
- Console and network telemetry

### OpenClaw Gateway

Splice ships an optional local [OpenClaw](https://github.com/NikMuv142/Splice) control gateway that lets OpenClaw-compatible agents connect directly over a low-latency WebSocket channel. The gateway is **disabled by default** and never opens a network socket unless explicitly opted in.

```bash
# Enable at startup
SPLICE_ENABLE_OPENCLAW=1 node dist/index.js

# Custom port (default: 18789)
SPLICE_ENABLE_OPENCLAW=1 OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT=19000 node dist/index.js
```

You can also toggle the gateway at runtime without restarting the server:

```json
{
  "name": "toggle_openclaw_gateway",
  "arguments": { "enabled": true }
}
```

When active, connecting OpenClaw agents receive an immediate handshake:

```json
{
  "event": "handshake",
  "status": "connected",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "engine": "Splice Enterprise Browser Core"
}
```

The gateway binds exclusively to `127.0.0.1` — it is never reachable from the network.

### Discord Notifications

Splice includes a built-in Discord webhook client that can fire rich embed alerts for significant autonomous events (human interventions required, deadlocks detected, security audit completions). Configure it via environment variable or MCP tool:

```bash
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/... node dist/index.js
```

or at runtime:

```json
{
  "name": "configure_discord_webhook",
  "arguments": { "webhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/..." }
}
```

> **Note**: Discord notifications are currently **on hold** and will not fire until re-enabled in a future release. The infrastructure is fully wired; the integration can be activated by removing the `on hold` guard in `DiscordWebhook.ts`.

Splice uses a TypeScript core for browser control and a Python MCP wrapper for agent ecosystems that prefer Python entrypoints.

---

## Quick Start

### Node MCP Server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikMuv142/Splice.git
cd Splice
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

### Python MCP Wrapper

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NikMuv142/Splice.git
cd Splice
npm install
npm run build
cd python
python -m pip install -e .
splice-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop Example

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "splice": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/Splice/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients

Splice can be used from any application that supports the Model Context Protocol and stdio servers.

Use the built server entrypoint:

```bash
node /absolute/path/to/Splice/dist/index.js
```

Or, if the app prefers a Python entrypoint:

```bash
splice-mcp
```

Typical MCP client config shape:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "splice": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/Splice/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

If your MCP-capable app lets you choose between multiple transports, use `stdio`.

### Command Center

Splice runs headless by default. You can open the Command Center in a browser-friendly localhost viewer:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js dashboard
```

That starts a local server, typically at:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1:4821
```

Splice can also auto-open the localhost Command Center when the MCP server starts:

```bash
SPLICE_AUTO_OPEN_DASHBOARD=1 node dist/index.js
```

You can also generate a report from the MCP tool:

```json
{
  "name": "generate_observability_report",
  "arguments": {}
}
```

Or launch the localhost viewer directly from MCP:

```json
{
  "name": "launch_command_center",
  "arguments": {
    "preferredPort": 4821
  }
}
```

### Splice CLI

Splice also ships a local CLI with a pixel-style banner and deployable Gemini-backed coding agents:

```bash
npm run build
node dist/cli.js logo
node dist/cli.js config set-gemini-key YOUR_GEMINI_KEY
node dist/cli.js agents deploy all . --run
```

Available agent roles:

- `review` — bug, regression, and test-gap review
- `optimize` — performance and maintainability recommendations
- `secure` — security and secret-exposure review

Agent manifests and local CLI config are stored under `.splice/cli/`, which is ignored by git.

#### CLI quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run build

# show the CLI banner
node dist/cli.js logo

# save your Gemini key locally for this repo only
node dist/cli.js config set-gemini-key YOUR_GEMINI_KEY

# inspect config (key is masked)
node dist/cli.js config show

# deploy and run a review agent against the current repo
node dist/cli.js agents review .

# deploy all three agents and run them
node dist/cli.js agents deploy all . --run

# list deployed agent manifests
node dist/cli.js agents list

# rerun a specific deployed agent later
node dist/cli.js agents run AGENT_ID
```

#### What the CLI is for

- `review` checks correctness, regressions, and missing tests in your codebase
- `optimize` looks for performance and maintainability wins in your codebase
- `secure` looks for secrets, unsafe defaults, and security hardening gaps in your codebase

The CLI agents analyze a codebase path. They are for repo review, optimization, and security analysis, not browser-driving a website.

### Testing A Website Or Your Own App

There are two practical ways to try Splice:

#### 1. Test Splice itself locally

This proves the full feature path on a throwaway fixture app:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

That run checks:

- browser launch and navigation
- telemetry capture
- obstruction detection
- verified action planning and execution
- prompt-injection redaction
- Gemini-style secret blocking on outbound POSTs
- encrypted snapshot save/load
- security audit generation
- OpenClaw gateway handshake
- Command Center report generation
- multi-agent coordination conflict and handoff logic

#### 2. Test against a real website or your own localhost app

If you want to drive a real site, run Splice as an MCP server and connect it from an MCP-capable client:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
node dist/index.js
```

Then use these tool calls in your MCP client:

```json
{
  "name": "navigate",
  "arguments": {
    "url": "http://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "diagnose_agent_state",
  "arguments": {
    "goal": "submit the signup form"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "compile_verified_action",
  "arguments": {
    "intent": "type email address",
    "value": "me@example.com",
    "execute": true,
    "constraints": {
      "avoidDestructiveActions": true
    }
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "name": "run_security_audit",
  "arguments": {
    "targetUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
    "safeMode": true,
    "crawl": true,
    "maxCrawlDepth": 3
  }
}
```

#### Suggested flow for your own app

1. Start your app locally, for example `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Start Splice with `node dist/index.js`.
3. Connect your MCP client to Splice.
4. Call `navigate` to open your app.
5. Call `get_semantic_tree_optimized` or `diagnose_agent_state` to inspect the current page.
6. Call `compile_verified_action` with `execute: true` to safely try an interaction.
7. Call `run_security_audit` for a browser-level security pass.
8. Call `generate_observability_report` to get a local HTML Command Center report.

#### Good targets to try first

- your local dev app on `localhost`
- a staging environment you control
- a small static site you own

Start with non-destructive flows like login pages, search forms, settings pages, docs navigation, or signup flows before pointing it at anything sensitive.

### Prove It Locally

Splice includes a deterministic local validation/demo run. It starts a throwaway web app on `127.0.0.1`, drives Chromium through the advertised failure modes, and writes two human-viewable artifacts:

- a local validation report with pass/fail results
- a Command Center report populated with forensics, verified action plans, security audit findings, branches, telemetry, and live-feed events

```bash
npm test
```

or:

```bash
npm run demo:local
```

The validation covers:

- Agent State Forensics detecting and recovering from an overlay obstruction
- Verified Intent Actions planning, executing, and verifying a form workflow
- Semantic Security lens prompt-injection redaction
- non-GET secret egress blocking
- encrypted snapshot save/load
- security audit feedback
- OpenClaw gateway handshake and status command
- Command Center report generation
- multi-agent ownership, quorum conflict, handoff, and summon coordination checks

The command prints the exact report paths when it finishes.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SPLICE_AUTO_OPEN_DASHBOARD` | `0` | Set to `1` to auto-open the Command Center dashboard on startup. |
| `SPLICE_ENABLE_OPENCLAW` | `0` | Set to `1` to start the OpenClaw WebSocket gateway on boot. |
| `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT` | `18789` | Override the OpenClaw gateway port. Only used if `SPLICE_ENABLE_OPENCLAW=1`. |
| `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` | _(unset)_ | Full Discord webhook URL for automated event notifications. _(on hold)_ |

---

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm test
python3 -m compileall python/splice_mcp
```

The test suite launches Playwright Chromium against a local fixture app, so it does not require public internet access. On locked-down local environments, browser launch may require host permissions even when TypeScript compilation succeeds.

Package shape can be checked with:

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

---

## Security Model

Splice follows a zero-trust browser posture:

- Session metadata is encrypted with AES-256-GCM.
- Browser contexts are isolated per branch/session.
- Prompt-injection patterns are redacted before agent consumption.
- Secret-looking payloads are blocked from outbound non-GET requests.
- Dashboard auto-open is opt-in via `SPLICE_AUTO_OPEN_DASHBOARD=1`.
- Arbitrary Python execution is not exposed through the MCP wrapper.
- The OpenClaw gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` only and is **disabled by default** — it must be explicitly opted in via `SPLICE_ENABLE_OPENCLAW=1` or `toggle_openclaw_gateway`.
- The security auditor actively scans for unsecured OpenClaw ports, DOM-level WebSocket script injections, and unverified high-privilege skills.

Please report vulnerabilities privately. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

---

## Roadmap

- Delta-first observations that explain only what changed after the last action
- Policy packs for enterprise workflows and destructive-action approvals
- Browser replay summaries that explain failed traces in agent-readable language
- More first-party lenses for accessibility, commerce, auth, and SaaS workflows
- Benchmarks for real coding-agent browser debugging tasks
- Activate Discord webhook notifications for significant autonomous events
- OpenClaw protocol extensions for multi-modal tool calling
